/// A class representing a content card template with an image-only layout.

/// `ImageOnlyTemplate` is a subclass of `BaseTemplate` and conforms to the `ContentCardTemplate` protocol.
/// It provides a structured layout for content cards that include only an image that can be tapped like a button.
/// This class is initialized with `ContentCardSchemaData`, which is used to populate the template's properties.
/// If the required `image` is missing from the schema data, the initialization fails.
///
/// - Note: The `view` property is lazily initialized and represents the entire layout of the content card.
